The site presents compelling academic content and establishes the organization's expertise in peace and conflict resolution, but lacks the essential conversion elements, strategic user journeys, and clear calls-to-action needed to transform interest into action.\n\nThe biggest barriers to organizational success include the complete disconnection between content and conversion opportunities, missing critical decision-making information (pricing, schedules, enrollment processes), and the absence of compelling reasons to donate or participate in trainings. The site functions primarily as an informational repository rather than a conversion-focused platform, creating significant missed opportunities to advance organizational goals.\n\n## KEY FINDINGS\n\n### Top 3 content and user experience strengths that support organizational goals\n\n1. **Professional Academic Content Quality** - The website presents well-structured, authoritative content about research methodologies, training courses, and project work that establishes credibility and expertise in peace and conflict resolution.\n\n2. **Clear Training Course Categorization** - The training page effectively categorizes different course offerings with color-coding and consistent formatting, making it easy for users to understand the range of available educational opportunities.\n\n3. **Strong Visual Brand Identity** - The consistent use of the EPI logo, blue color scheme, and professional imagery creates a cohesive visual identity appropriate for an academic peace institute, building initial trust with visitors.\n\n### Top 5 critical barriers to organizational success\n\n1. **Missing Conversion Pathways** (Severity: High) - The website fails to connect content consumption to action, with minimal donation prompts and no direct training registration options. How to Fix: Implement contextual calls-to-action throughout content sections that directly link to donation forms and training registration pages.\n\n2. **Incomplete Decision-Critical Information** (Severity: High) - Essential information for decision-making is missing across the site, including training dates, pricing, delivery format, and donation impact. How to Fix: Add complete course information (dates, pricing, delivery format) and donation usage transparency to remove barriers to conversion.\n\n3. **Misaligned Homepage Focus** (Severity: High) - The homepage prioritizes team member profiles over organizational impact, training opportunities, and donation appeals, failing to advance primary goals. How to Fix: Restructure the homepage to prioritize content that directly supports donations and training sign-ups, with compelling impact stories and clear calls-to-action.\n\n4. **Lack of Compelling Value Propositions** (Severity: Medium) - The site fails to clearly articulate why users should donate or participate in trainings beyond basic descriptions of content. How to Fix: Develop concrete value propositions for both donation and training participation, highlighting tangible benefits, outcomes, and impact.\n\n5. **Ineffective Contact Engagement** (Severity: Medium) - The contact page provides only a basic form without context, alternative contact methods, or strategic connections to primary goals. How to Fix: Transform the contact page into a strategic conversion point with contextual information, multiple contact options, and targeted calls-to-action related to donations and trainings.\n\n## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### Content & messaging improvements (Priority 1)\n\n1. **Develop Impact-Focused Content** (Impact: High, Effort: Medium) - Create compelling impact stories and case studies demonstrating concrete outcomes of the institute's work, connecting emotional response to donation appeals and training value.\n\n2. **Complete Course Information** (Impact: High, Effort: Low) - Add comprehensive information to each training course, including pricing, dates, delivery format, prerequisites, and expected outcomes to support informed decision-making.\n\n3. **Create Donation Value Narratives** (Impact: High, Effort: Medium) - Develop specific content explaining how donations are used, what impact different donation amounts have, and why financial support is critical to the organization's mission.\n\n4. **Implement Homepage Goal Alignment** (Impact: High, Effort: Medium) - Restructure the homepage to prioritize content that directly supports donations and training sign-ups, with compelling visuals, testimonials, and clear calls-to-action.\n\n5. **Develop FAQ Content** (Impact: Medium, Effort: Low) - Create comprehensive FAQ sections for both training programs and donation processes to address common questions and remove decision barriers.\n\n### User experience & conversion optimizations (Priority 2)\n\n1. **Implement Strategic CTAs** (Impact: High, Effort: Low) - Add contextual calls-to-action throughout all content pages that directly connect to donation and training sign-up opportunities.\n\n2. **Create Streamlined Registration Process** (Impact: High, Effort: Medium) - Develop a simplified training registration flow that minimizes steps between interest and commitment, with course-specific landing pages and optimized forms.\n\n3. **Implement Donation Options Array** (Impact: High, Effort: Medium) - Create multiple donation pathways including one-time, recurring, and project-specific options with suggested amounts and impact statements.\n\n4. **Optimize Mobile Conversion Paths** (Impact: Medium, Effort: Medium) - Ensure all donation and registration processes are fully optimized for mobile users with simplified forms and touch-friendly elements.\n\n5. **Add Secondary Conversion Points** (Impact: Medium, Effort: Low) - Implement lower-commitment conversion options such as newsletter signup, downloadable resources, or event notifications to build an engagement pipeline.\n\n### Trust & credibility enhancements (Priority 3)\n\n1. **Implement Comprehensive Social Proof** (Impact: High, Effort: Medium) - Add testimonials from training participants, organizational partners, and donation impact stories throughout the site.\n\n2. **Create Transparency Section** (Impact: Medium, Effort: Medium) - Develop a dedicated section showing how donations are used, with financial transparency and impact metrics.\n\n3. **Enhance Team Presentation** (Impact: Medium, Effort: Low) - Optimize team member presentations to emphasize expertise relevant to training offerings and research impact rather than just academic credentials.\n\n4. **Add Partner Organization Logos** (Impact: Medium, Effort: Low) - Display logos of partner organizations, universities, and funding bodies to establish credibility through association.\n\n5. **Implement Trust Certificates** (Impact: Low, Effort: Low) - Add relevant trust certificates, security indicators, and charitable registration information prominently throughout the site.\n\n### Technical & accessibility improvements (Priority 4)\n\n1. **Optimize LCP Performance** (Impact: Medium, Effort: Medium) - Improve Largest Contentful Paint scores, particularly on the Projects page (48%), through image optimization and critical rendering path enhancements.\n\n2. **Implement Resource Prioritization** (Impact: Low, Effort: Low) - Add resource hints (preload, preconnect) for critical assets to improve perceived performance, especially for first-time visitors.\n\n3. **Enhance Mobile Form Usability** (Impact: Medium, Effort: Low) - Optimize form elements on Contact and potential Registration pages for mobile users to reduce abandonment rates.\n\n## ORGANIZATIONAL ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT\n\n### How effectively the website supports: to encourage donations and sign-ups for trainings\n\nThe Edinburgh Peace Institute website fundamentally fails to effectively support its primary goals of encouraging donations and training sign-ups. While the site successfully establishes organizational expertise through academic content, it creates no compelling pathways from interest to action. The disconnect between content consumption and conversion opportunities represents a significant strategic failure.\n\nFor training sign-ups, the site provides basic information about available courses but lacks the essential details (pricing, dates, delivery format) and streamlined processes needed to convert interest into registration. The absence of direct registration options and the reliance on general \"Enquire Now\" buttons creates unnecessary friction in the user journey.\n\nFor donations, the situation is even more problematic, with minimal donation messaging throughout the site and no compelling cases for financial support tied to the organization's impact. The donation button in the navigation remains disconnected from emotional content that would motivate giving.\n\n### Content gaps preventing goal achievement\n\n1. **Missing Training Details** - Critical information including pricing, dates, schedules, delivery format (online/in-person), and registration processes is absent, preventing informed decision-making.\n\n2. **Absent Donation Impact Information** - No content explains how donations are used, what impact different amounts have, or why financial support is critical to the organization's mission.\n\n3. **Lack of Outcome Evidence** - The site provides minimal evidence of past successes, participant outcomes, or project impacts that would motivate engagement.\n\n4. **Insufficient Value Propositions** - Content focuses on describing activities rather than articulating clear value propositions for training participation or donation.\n\n5. **No Urgency Messaging** - The site lacks content creating urgency for either training registration (limited spaces, upcoming deadlines) or donations (matching opportunities, time-limited campaigns).\n\n### Trust and credibility factors impacting conversions\n\n1. **Strong Academic Credentials** - The detailed team profiles and research methodologies establish strong academic credibility, which is a positive foundation but insufficient alone to drive conversions.\n\n2. **Limited Social Proof** - The website includes minimal testimonials and no aggregate social proof (participant numbers, total impact) that would build trust through external validation.\n\n3. **Missing Transparency Information** - The site lacks transparency about how donations are used, organizational finances, or governance, which can reduce trust for potential donors.\n\n4. **Professional Visual Presentation** - The clean, professional design creates a positive initial impression appropriate for an academic institution, helping establish baseline credibility.\n\n5. **Incomplete Contact Information** - The limited contact options (form only, no direct emails or phone numbers) can reduce trust, particularly for users considering significant financial donations.\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP\n\n### Immediate content fixes (1-2 weeks)\n\n1. Add complete training course information including pricing, dates, delivery format, and prerequisites\n2. Implement contextual donation and training calls-to-action throughout all content pages\n3. Create brief impact statements for each project showing outcomes and connecting to donation value\n4. Add alternative contact methods (direct email, phone) to the Contact page\n5. Develop brief FAQ sections for both training programs and donation processes\n\n### User experience improvements (1-2 months)\n\n1. Restructure the homepage to prioritize content supporting donations and training sign-ups\n2. Create dedicated landing pages for each training course with comprehensive information\n3. Implement a streamlined training registration process with minimal steps\n4. Develop multiple donation pathways with suggested amounts and impact statements\n5. Add testimonials and social proof throughout the site\n6. Optimize images to improve LCP performance, particularly on the Projects page\n\n### Strategic enhancements (3-6 months)\n\n1. Develop comprehensive impact storytelling connecting emotional response to donation appeals\n2. Create a resource library with downloadable materials requiring email signup\n3. Implement a donor recognition program and transparent impact reporting system\n4. Develop an email nurturing sequence for training and donation prospects\n5. Create a community engagement section highlighting participant successes and ongoing initiatives\n6. Implement advanced conversion optimization based on analytics data and user testing\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, the Edinburgh Peace Institute can transform its website from an information repository into a strategic asset that effectively advances its goals of encouraging donations and training sign-ups through compelling content, streamlined user journeys, and strategic conversion optimization."

FIRST IMPRESSION & CLARITY (Score: 7/10)\n- The page clearly communicates that training courses are being offered related to peace, mediation, and humanitarian work\n- The visual layout presents each course as a distinct offering with a consistent format\n- The introduction statement effectively communicates the credibility of the courses\n- Navigation is simple and the page purpose is evident within seconds\n- EVIDENCE: The header states courses are \"developed from on the ground experience, studied and lectured at the highest academic levels,\" immediately establishing credibility and purpose\n\n## 2. GOAL ALIGNMENT & CONTENT RELEVANCE (Score: 6/10)\n- The page effectively showcases training offerings, supporting one of the organization's key goals\n- Each course has a dedicated section with relevant details and testimonials\n- However, the call-to-action for enrollment is weak and doesn't create urgency\n- No clear pathway to actual registration or payment\n- EVIDENCE: Each \"Enquire Now\" button is small and doesn't strongly encourage immediate action; no pricing information is visible for any course\n\n## 3. VISUAL DESIGN & CONTENT PRESENTATION (Score: 8/10)\n- Consistent color-coding system helps distinguish between different course offerings\n- Clean layout with ample white space makes information digestible\n- The accordion-style elements (Who is it for?, Leadership Element, etc.) create organized information hierarchy\n- Testimonial quotes are well-positioned beside course descriptions\n- EVIDENCE: Each course uses a distinct color scheme (blue, green, red, yellow) with matching geometric background elements that create visual interest while maintaining focus on content\n\n## 4. CONTENT COMPLETENESS & QUALITY (Score: 6/10)\n- Course descriptions are detailed and professional\n- Strong testimonials add credibility to each offering\n- Missing critical information: pricing, dates/schedule, delivery format (online/in-person)\n- The collapsible sections suggest more detail but require user interaction to access\n- EVIDENCE: The \"Course Duration\" and \"Course Syllabus\" sections are collapsed by default, hiding potentially decision-critical information\n\n## 5. USER JOURNEY & DECISION SUPPORT (Score: 5/10)\n- The page provides good information about what each course covers and who it's for\n- However, the user journey stalls at the \"Enquire Now\" step with no clear indication of next steps\n- No FAQ section addressing common questions about logistics, prerequisites, or outcomes\n- EVIDENCE: No information about application process, selection criteria, or what happens after clicking \"Enquire Now\"\n\n## 6. CONVERSION & ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION (Score: 4/10)\n- The \"Enquire Now\" buttons are the only conversion points but lack prominence\n- No sense of urgency or limited availability messaging to encourage immediate action\n- Missing social proof beyond individual testimonials (e.g., number of participants, organizational partners)\n- No secondary conversion options (e.g., newsletter signup, downloadable syllabus)\n- EVIDENCE: The small \"Enquire Now\" buttons blend into the page without visual emphasis; no indication of course dates that might create time pressure\n\n## 7. TECHNICAL EXECUTION & ACCESSIBILITY (Score: 8/10)\n- The page has a clean, accessible design with good contrast for readability\n- Collapsible sections help manage information density\n- Page appears well-structured for screen readers with logical content flow\n- Navigation is straightforward and intuitive\n- EVIDENCE: Clear heading hierarchy, good text-to-background contrast, and logical content organization throughout the page\n\n## CRITICAL FLAWS:\n\n1. Incomplete Decision-Making Information (Severity: High) - The page lacks essential information for enrollment decisions including pricing, specific dates/schedules, and delivery format (online/in-person), preventing users from moving forward without an additional step of inquiry.  \n   How to Fix: Add clear pricing information, upcoming course dates, and delivery format details for each course directly on the page.\n\n2. Weak Call-to-Action Implementation (Severity: Medium) - The \"Enquire Now\" buttons lack visual prominence and urgency, with no clear indication of the next steps in the enrollment process, reducing conversion likelihood.  \n   How to Fix: Redesign CTAs with more visual prominence, add explanatory text about the enrollment process, and consider adding a direct \"Register\" option for courses with fixed dates.\n\n3. Limited Social Proof and Credibility Indicators (Severity: Medium) - While individual testimonials exist, the page lacks broader evidence of organizational success such as number of past participants, organizational partners, or success metrics.  \n   How to Fix: Add statistics about past participants, logos of partner organizations, and specific outcome metrics to build greater trust and credibility.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. Add Complete Course Information (Impact: High) - Include pricing, specific dates/schedules, and delivery format (online/in-person) for each course directly on the page without requiring user interaction.  \n   Benefit: Removes friction in the decision-making process, allowing users to evaluate offerings completely before committing to inquiry.\n\n2. Implement a Streamlined Registration Process (Impact: High) - Replace or supplement the \"Enquire Now\" buttons with a direct registration option that links to a simplified form pre-populated with the selected course.  \n   Benefit: Reduces the steps between interest and commitment, likely increasing conversion rates significantly.\n\n3. Create Course-Specific Landing Pages (Impact: Medium) - Develop dedicated pages for each course with expanded details, full syllabus, instructor bios, and FAQs.  \n   Benefit: Provides depth of information for serious prospects while keeping the main training page as a navigational hub.\n\n4. Add Social Proof Section (Impact: Medium) - Create a dedicated section showcasing statistics (participants trained, countries represented), partner logos, and aggregated feedback scores.  \n   Benefit: Builds trust and credibility, particularly important for international and high-level professional training.\n\n5. Implement Course Availability Indicators (Impact: Medium) - Add visual indicators showing limited spaces, upcoming deadlines, or \"filling fast\" notifications where appropriate.  \n   Benefit: Creates urgency and encourages immediate action rather than delayed decision-making.\n\n## SUMMARY:\nOverall Effectiveness Score: 6/10\n\nThe Edinburgh Peace Institute training page effectively communicates course content and target audiences but fails to provide critical decision-making information and lacks strong conversion pathways. The page design is professional and well-organized, but the absence of pricing, dates, and clear next steps creates unnecessary barriers to enrollment. \n\nHighest Priority Action: Add complete course information including pricing, dates, and delivery format directly on the page to enable immediate decision-making without requiring additional inquiry steps.\n\n## PAGE ROLE ANALYSIS:\nThis page partially fulfills its purpose of encouraging sign-ups for trainings by clearly presenting the course offerings and their value, but it stops short of providing the complete information needed for conversion. The most critical missing elements are pricing details, specific scheduling information, and a clear, frictionless path to registration. While the page builds trust through professional design and testimonials, it fails to create urgency or reduce the friction in the decision-making and enrollment process, likely resulting in lower conversion rates than possible with optimization.",

How to Fix: Add contextual calls-to-action throughout the content (e.g., \"Support this research through donation\" or \"Learn these methodologies in our training programs\") with direct links to relevant action pages.\n\n2. **Lack of Impact Evidence** (Severity: Medium) - The page describes research approaches but doesn't provide concrete examples of outcomes or success stories that would build credibility and motivate engagement. How to Fix: Add case studies, impact statistics, or testimonials that demonstrate real-world applications and results of the research methodologies described.\n\n3. **Unexpanded Content in Dropdowns** (Severity: Medium) - The Protection & Safeguarding section uses dropdowns without preview text, hiding potentially valuable information and requiring user action to discover content relevance. How to Fix: Add brief preview text for each dropdown section to help users understand what information they'll find before clicking, increasing the likelihood they'll engage with this content.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. **Create Research-to-Training Connections** (Impact: High) - Add explicit links between research methodologies described and specific training offerings, with phrases like \"Learn this approach in our Conflict Resolution Training\" after each methodology section. Benefit: Creates clear pathways for users interested in the academic content to become training participants, directly supporting a primary organizational goal.\n\n2. **Add Contextual Donation Appeals** (Impact: High) - Incorporate targeted donation appeals tied to specific research initiatives, explaining how donations enable the protection of vulnerable communities during research. Benefit: Transforms academic interest into financial support by creating emotional and logical connections between the organization's expertise and need for funding.\n\n3. **Develop Case Study Section** (Impact: Medium) - Create a section highlighting 2-3 brief case studies demonstrating the real-world application and impact of the organization's research approaches. Benefit: Builds credibility and demonstrates value, making both training participation and donations more compelling by showing concrete outcomes.\n\n4. **Implement a Resource Library** (Impact: Medium) - Create a downloadable resource section with research papers or summary reports that requires email signup, creating a lower-commitment conversion point. Benefit: Builds an email list for nurturing potential donors and training participants while providing immediate value to research-interested visitors.\n\n5. **Add Researcher Profiles** (Impact: Low) - Include brief profiles of key researchers with their expertise and backgrounds to humanize the academic content. Benefit: Builds trust and credibility by showing the qualified individuals behind the methodologies, making users more likely to support through donations or training participation.\n\n## SUMMARY:\n\n**Overall Effectiveness Score: 5/10**\n\nThe Edinburgh Peace Institute research page effectively communicates academic expertise and methodological approaches but fundamentally fails to connect this content to the organization's primary goals of securing donations and training sign-ups. The page represents a missed opportunity to convert interest in intellectual content into tangible support and engagement.\n\n**Highest Priority Action:** Implement clear pathways from research content to both donation opportunities and training programs by adding contextual calls-to-action throughout the page that explicitly connect the research methodologies to ways users can support or learn these approaches.\n\n## PAGE ROLE ANALYSIS:\nThis research page currently serves as an information repository rather than an active component of the conversion funnel. While it effectively establishes expertise, it fails to leverage this credibility to advance organizational goals. The page needs significant optimization to transform intellectual interest into action, particularly by creating explicit connections between research methodologies and available training programs, and by demonstrating how donations directly enable the protection of vulnerable communities during research initiatives.",

      "original_analysis": "# UX/UI Analysis: Edinburgh Peace Institute Contact Page\n\n## 1. FIRST IMPRESSION & CLARITY (Score: 6/10)\n- The page clearly identifies itself as a contact page with a straightforward form\n- The large \"EPI\" logo and organization name establish identity, but take up significant visual space\n- There's no introduction or context explaining why someone should contact the organization\n- The page lacks any guidance on what types of inquiries are appropriate or expected response times\n- EVIDENCE: The page jumps directly to the contact form without explaining its purpose or providing alternatives like phone numbers or emails\n\n## 2. GOAL ALIGNMENT & CONTENT RELEVANCE (Score: 5/10)\n- The contact form technically allows users to reach out, but does nothing to advance primary organizational goals\n- No connection is made between contacting the organization and potential training sign-ups or donations\n- No information about available trainings, donation options, or how to get involved\n- No context is provided for what happens after submitting the form\n- EVIDENCE: The form exists in isolation without supporting content that ties back to the organization's goals of encouraging donations and training sign-ups\n\n## 3. VISUAL DESIGN & CONTENT PRESENTATION (Score: 6/10)\n- The large \"EPI\" background graphic creates a strong visual identity but dominates the page\n- The contact form has clear field labels and a simple layout\n- The blue/gray form background creates adequate contrast for readability\n- Navigation and donate button are clearly visible in the header\n- EVIDENCE: The minimal design is clean but lacks supporting visuals or content elements that would build trust or motivate engagement\n\n## 4. CONTENT COMPLETENESS & QUALITY (Score: 4/10)\n- Critical contact information is missing - no phone numbers, email addresses, or operating hours\n- No indication of what department will receive the message or expected response times\n- No FAQ section to address common inquiries that might eliminate the need for contact\n- No context about the organization's work that would build trust before submitting information\n- EVIDENCE: The page only contains a basic contact form and footer information with physical address, lacking comprehensive contact options\n\n## 5. USER JOURNEY & DECISION SUPPORT (Score: 3/10)\n- The page provides no guidance on next steps after form submission\n- No alternative contact methods for urgent inquiries or specific departments\n- No content addressing what users might want to contact the organization about\n- No supporting information to help users decide if contacting is their best option\n- EVIDENCE: Users encounter only a basic form with no contextual information about how their inquiry will be handled or alternative pathways\n\n## 6. CONVERSION & ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION (Score: 4/10)\n- The \"Donate\" button is present in the header but not emphasized or explained on this page\n- No call-to-action related to trainings, which is a stated organizational goal\n- No trust indicators (testimonials, partner logos, etc.) that would encourage engagement\n- Form lacks any explanation of what happens after submission (confirmation, response time)\n- EVIDENCE: The page fails to capitalize on potential conversion opportunities by not connecting contact actions to key organizational goals\n\n## 7. TECHNICAL EXECUTION & ACCESSIBILITY (Score: 8/10)\n- Form fields are clearly labeled with required fields indicated\n- Simple, straightforward submission process with a clear \"Send\" button\n- Form appears functional and properly structured\n- Good accessibility scores (100%) suggest the page is usable for people with disabilities\n- EVIDENCE: The contact form follows standard form design practices with clear field labels and a simple submission process\n\n## CRITICAL FLAWS:\n\n1. Missing Purpose Context (Severity: High) - The page provides no explanation of when, why, or how to contact the organization, leaving users without guidance on appropriate inquiries or expectations. How to Fix: Add a brief introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the contact form, types of inquiries welcomed, and expected response times.\n\n2. No Alternative Contact Methods (Severity: Medium) - The page only offers a contact form without providing direct email addresses, phone numbers, or specific departmental contacts. How to Fix: Add additional contact methods including phone numbers with hours of availability, direct email addresses for different departments, and social media contact options.\n\n3. No Connection to Organizational Goals (Severity: High) - The contact page fails to connect to the organization's primary goals of encouraging donations and training sign-ups. How to Fix: Add relevant calls-to-action related to trainings and donations alongside the contact form, and include specific contact options for training inquiries and donation support.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. Add Contextual Introduction (Impact: High) - Create a brief, welcoming introduction at the top of the page explaining who should use the contact form, what types of inquiries are appropriate, and what users can expect after submission. Benefit: Provides clarity to users, reduces inappropriate inquiries, and sets proper expectations for response times.\n\n2. Expand Contact Options (Impact: Medium) - Add phone numbers, direct email addresses for different departments, operating hours, and social media contact alternatives. Benefit: Gives users multiple ways to reach the organization based on their preferences and urgency needs.\n\n3. Create Topic-Based Contact Routing (Impact: Medium) - Add a dropdown field to the form allowing users to select their inquiry type (e.g., \"Training Information,\" \"Donation Questions,\" \"Partnership Opportunities\"). Benefit: Streamlines internal routing of inquiries and signals to users that the organization is prepared to address their specific needs.\n\n4. Add Strategic CTAs Related to Key Goals (Impact: High) - Include clear calls-to-action related to training sign-ups and donations alongside the contact form with descriptive text. Benefit: Directly connects the contact page to organizational goals, potentially increasing conversion rates for primary objectives.\n\n5. Implement Trust-Building Elements (Impact: Medium) - Add testimonials, partner logos, or impact statistics to build credibility while users are considering contacting the organization. Benefit: Increases user confidence in the organization, making them more likely to submit inquiries or take other desired actions.\n\n## SUMMARY:\n\nOverall Effectiveness Score: 5/10\n\nThe Edinburgh Peace Institute contact page is functionally adequate but represents a significant missed opportunity to advance organizational goals. The page lacks context, alternative contact methods, and strategic connections to training sign-ups and donations. It fails to build trust or provide users with a clear understanding of what to expect after submission. The highest priority action should be redesigning the page to include contextual information about contacting the organization while strategically incorporating calls-to-action that directly support training sign-ups and donations.\n\n## PAGE ROLE ANALYSIS:\nThis contact page fulfills its basic function of providing a way for users to submit inquiries, but completely fails to leverage this touchpoint to advance the organization's goals of encouraging donations and training sign-ups. It lacks essential information about response expectations, alternative contact methods, and departmental routing that users would expect on a contact page. The page does nothing to connect users to logical next steps in their journey or demonstrate value that would build trust at this engagement stage. A contact page should be more than just a form—it should be a strategic conversion opportunity that this implementation completely misses.",
